//-if one method of class is abstract then one must have to make class abstract...
//-if class is abstract then its not compolsory that there is abstract method as well as there is full method. 
//-if all method of class area abstract then it is not complosory to create interface. it is used by class as well and can be called by child by extends keyword.
//-interface force child to ovverride and complete abstract methods. 
//-child class uses implements keyword to implements interface parent class
